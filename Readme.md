TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

What is TypeScript? 

JavaScript and More
TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.

A Result You Can Trust
TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

Safety at Scale
TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.


So We will be Looking These Tupscript Concepts and Features and Learn as we go on.
1. What is Typescript language and Why should ou use it in the place of javascript.
2. Installing Typescript Compiler in the Project and System. Compiling the ts File with tsc command.
3. Compiling Typescript Code and Compare the Compiled javascript code with typescript code.
4. Typescript Types. Ltes learn the typescript types like number, boolean and strings.
5. Type Assignmemt and Type inference. Assign type directly to variable while declaring. Typescript.
6. Object Types in the Typescript. Decalring the type for the object in the Typescript.
7. Array Types in Typescript.Define the types of the array as _ in the typescript.
8. Tuples in the Typescript.Lets learn the tuples data type in the typescript language.

12. Function return value types and void in Typscript. Difference Between Void and Undefined Type.
13. Assign Function as Types to a Variable with argument types adn retrun types in Typescript.
14. Unknown Type and Never Type in Typescript. Know all aboit the unknown and never Types.
15. Typescript Compiler using watch mode. Compiling the entire project for the multiple ts File.
16. Include and Exclude ts Files with the tsconfig.josn configuration file in Typescript.
